Egyptian Fruit Bat Sound Classification project.
This is the graduation project of contributors. We are using LSTM and CNN in our model.
Our aim is embedding this model to microcontrollers, and realizing a system by which 
bats can be monitored remotely. To that end, we'll communicate this microcontroller with 
another microcontroller via communication protocols.
